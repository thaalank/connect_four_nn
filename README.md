# Connect4-NN
All development was done using Python 3.6

AIvsAI - run 1000 simulated games using randomAI

alpha_beta_class - class for my implementation of Minimax Algorithm with Alpha Beta pruning

connect4 - class for my implementation of connect4

driver - run this to play human vs human

heuristics_final - holds the various heuristic functions, also used to run scripts for comparing them 

minimax - original file of minimax implementation 

minimax_class - class for my minimax implementation 

mm_runner - run to simulate a game of minimax vs minimax 

mm_vs_ab - used to simulate a game of Alpha Beta vs Minimax

new_heuristics - file used to test the heuristic functions

play_ab - run to play a human vs alpha beta game 

play_mm - run to play a human vs minimax game

play_nn - run to play a human vs neural network game

pruning - original file holding alpha beta pruning implementation 

random_vs_ab - run to simulate a game between random ai and the alpha beta pruning algorithm

randomAI - run to play human vs random ai 

randomVSminimax - run to watch minimax defeat random ai 100 times (minimax is red)
